# Predicting Spotify Song Popularity Using Machine Learning

This project was created as a final assignment for a Machine Learning course. It uses Spotify audio feature data to predict whether a song is considered "popular" based on various numeric attributes.

## Project Overview
- Uses the `tracks.csv` dataset from Spotify (Kaggle)
- Builds and evaluates two ML models: Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors
- Focuses on handling class imbalance and evaluating performance using metrics like precision and recall

## Dataset
This project uses the [Spotify 12M Songs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs) from Kaggle.  
Due to file size limits, the full dataset is not included in this repository.

## Code
All code is contained in the Jupyter notebook:  
`Project(1).ipynb`

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
